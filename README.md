# now-status

This is a simple backend script I built to fetch my **latest GitHub repository** and generate a live status file (`now.json`) that I can use to show what I‚Äôm currently working on.

---

## What is this for?

I use this project to create a **live ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm working on‚Äù feed** for my personal portfolio website by:

- Automatically pulling the **most recently created GitHub repository** using the GitHub API.
- Updating a JSON file (`now.json`) with the repository name and the timestamp.
- Making this status publicly accessible so my portfolio frontend can display it in real-time.

---

## How it works

1. The script uses my GitHub username and a Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate with the GitHub API.
2. It fetches my most recently created public GitHub repository.
3. It extracts the repository name.
4. It writes this information into a `now.json` file along with the current timestamp.
5. My portfolio website fetches this JSON file and displays the live status.

---

## Usage

- I store my GitHub username and token securely in a `.env` file.
- I run the script manually or schedule it to update `now.json` regularly.
- I host `now.json` publicly (for example, via GitHub Pages or a static file server).
- My portfolio frontend fetches this file and shows my current work.

---

## Why I use this

- It keeps my portfolio fresh and dynamic with minimal manual effort.
- It shows potential employers or visitors what I‚Äôm actively working on.
- It leverages the GitHub API for real-time, automated updates.

---

## Notes

- I keep my GitHub token private and never commit it to public repositories.
- Using a token helps increase the API rate limits and avoids errors.

## üí• Handling Push Protection: Removing a Committed Secret

While developing, I accidentally committed a `.env` file that contained a **GitHub Personal Access Token**. GitHub‚Äôs security blocked the push due to **push protection**.

Here‚Äôs exactly how I fixed it:

### ‚úÖ Steps I Took to Fix the Error

1. **Installed `git-filter-repo`**
   ```bash
   pip install --user git-filter-repo
   export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
   git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths
   git remote add origin https://github.com/GregoryRobetertson/now-status.git
   git push -u origin main --force
   ```
